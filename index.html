<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>I am a sophomore at NJIT and am majoring in Information Technology. I love designing on Axure and recently did a group project for Johnson & Johnson's Technology Awareness Program (our team won!). I am Treasurer of NJIT's Habitat for Humanity and you could usually find me at the Murray Center on campus. I also  work at the Alumni Relations Office on campus. </p>

<h1>Outside of School</h1>
<p>When I am not working on assignments, I love reading and writing. I have less time to read these days, but when I do, I prefer dramatic works. Last week I finished Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, which I know I am very late to reading. I loved it! I also love watching true crime shows and documentaries. I have watched every episode of Buzzfeed Unsolved on YouTube and in quarantine over the summer I rewatched them. Besides true crime, I love a good comedy show like Frasier or Parks & Rec. My favorite is probably New Girl, which I have rewatched many mamy times. The only video games I really play are Mario Kart and Among Us, and for a little bit during quarantine I played Animal Crossing (I still do not understand the hype over that). My favorite musical artist is probably Michael Jackson. My parents own all his records so I grew up listening to him and still do. My favorite song by him at the moment is:  </p>
